In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.
All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds,<sup foot_note=76373>1</sup>
the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,
Master of the Day of Judgment.
You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help.
Guide us along the Straight Path,
the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray.<sup foot_note=76374>1</sup>
